      "Question": "My device is not being added to my local network",
      "Answer": "If your device is powered on and is no longer broadcasting the \"SmarterHome-XXX\" network, then it is connected to the network. Please try refreshing to search for your device. We have also seen that some routers block devices from searching for other devices on the network. If this is the case, please login to your router and look for the smarter home device. After finding your smarter home device on the network, please manually enter the IP address in the device details tab in settings"

      "Question": "My phone displays incorrect password when connecting to SmarterHome-XXX network",

      "Question": "My device is installed, but nothing is showing in the Home app",
      "Answer": "First ensure that the service is running using \"Check system status\" in the advanced settings tab. If the service is not running, then there is most likely an issue with one or more of your added accessories. If this is the case, please delete your last installed accessory and try re-adding it.\n If the service is running and you are still not seeing the accessory in the Home app, then make sure the textfields for that accessory are entered correctly and try again. Note in some cases we have found issues with routers and you may need to disable IGMP snooping in your router's settings"
